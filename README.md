## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

You can set up your own portfolio using this template in just a few minutes.

### 1. Obtain the Code

**Fork** this repository to your GitHub account, or **Clone** it locally:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/GNProject.git
```

### 2. Populate Your Projects

This is the most important step. Open `projects.json` and replace the sample data with your own projects. This file acts as your portfolio's database.

**Example Project Entry:**
```json
{
  "category": "android",
  "status": "Completed",
  "name": "My Awesome App",
  "version": "v2.1.0",
  "icon": "assets/icons/my-app-icon.png",
  "tags": ["Kotlin", "Jetpack Compose", "MVVM"],
  "description": "A detailed description of my awesome Android application.",
  "repoUrl": "https://github.com/your-username/your-repo",
  "screenshots": [
    "assets/screenshots/my-app-ss1.jpg",
    "assets/screenshots/my-app-ss2.jpg"
  ]
}
```
> **Note**: To hide the screenshot gallery for a project, set the `screenshots` value to `null`.

### 3. Add Your Images

Place your project icons and screenshots into the corresponding folders inside `assets/`:
-   **Icons**: `assets/icons/`
-   **Screenshots**: `assets/screenshots/`

Ensure the paths in `projects.json` correctly point to your image files.

### 4. Deploy

1.  Commit and push all your changes to your forked repository.
2.  In your repository's **Settings**, navigate to the **Pages** section.
3.  Under **Source**, select your `main` branch.
4.  GitHub will provide you with your live URL. Congratulations, your portfolio is now live!
